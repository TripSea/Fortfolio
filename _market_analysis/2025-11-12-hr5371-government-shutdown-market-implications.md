As a data-backed investment platform at Fortfolio, we prioritize informing our community on fiscal events that influence market stability. H.R.5371, the Continuing Appropriations, Agriculture, Legislative Branch, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Extensions Act, 2026, extends federal funding at 2025 levels through January 30, 2026. This continuing resolution addresses the ongoing shutdown that began October 1, 2025, marking a 43-day disruption—the longest on record—affecting all federal agencies, employee pay, and public services.

## Why This Bill Matters

Passage of H.R.5371 restores government operations, mitigating economic drag from halted services and fiscal uncertainty. Historical data from prior shutdowns, such as the 2018-2019 event, shows resolutions correlate with GDP recovery signals per U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reports. Legally, it reduces risks for investors tied to government contractors, aligning with compliance under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, but we advise monitoring SEC disruptions.

## Potential Stock Market Impacts

Based on Federal Reserve and U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data from similar events, shutdown resolutions typically yield short-term market relief. Here's a categorical breakdown:

### Major Indices

- **S&P 500**: Anticipated 1-2% gains post-resolution, mirroring a 1.5% rise after the 2019 shutdown.
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average**: Potential 0.5-1.5% uplift, driven by industrial recovery.
- **Nasdaq Composite**: Moderate 0.5-1% rebound, per SEC volatility reports.
- **VIX Index**: Expected 10% decline, reducing volatility as seen in 2013 data from CBOE.

### Key Sectors

- **Financials**: 1-2% gains from policy stability, per U.S. Department of Commerce insights.
- **Industrials**: 1-3% growth via resumed contracts.
- **Energy and Materials**: 1.5-4% rises, aligned with EIA supply chain data.
- **Technology**: 0.5-1.5% uplift in subsectors like semiconductors.
- **Healthcare**: Neutral-positive, stabilizing subsidies per congressional records.
- **Defense**: 1-3% gains from resumed military construction funding and contract payments, as evidenced by historical data where the sector lagged during the 2013 shutdown.

These projections draw from government-sourced historical trends.
