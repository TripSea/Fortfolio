Starting your journey in the stock market can feel overwhelming, but understanding the fundamentals is the first step to becoming a confident investor. This comprehensive guide breaks down everything you need to know.

## What is the Stock Market?

The stock market is a marketplace where investors buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. When you buy a stock, you're purchasing a small piece of ownership in that company.

### Key Market Concepts

**Stock Exchanges**: The primary venues where stocks are traded include:
- **NYSE (New York Stock Exchange)**: The world's largest stock exchange
- **NASDAQ**: Known for technology stocks
- **Other Global Exchanges**: LSE, TSE, and regional markets

**Market Participants**:
- Individual investors (retail traders)
- Institutional investors (hedge funds, mutual funds)
- Market makers who provide liquidity
- Broker-dealers who facilitate trades

## How the Stock Market Works

### Supply and Demand

Stock prices are determined by supply and demand. When more people want to buy a stock than sell it, the price goes up. When more people want to sell than buy, the price goes down.

### Market Orders vs. Limit Orders

**Market Order**: Buys or sells immediately at the current market price
- Guarantees execution
- Price may vary slightly from what you see

**Limit Order**: Buys or sells only at your specified price or better
- Guarantees price
- May not execute if price isn't reached

### Trading Hours

Regular trading hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST
- Pre-market: 4:00 AM - 9:30 AM EST
- After-hours: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM EST

## Types of Stocks

### Common Stock vs. Preferred Stock

**Common Stock**:
- Voting rights in company decisions
- Potential for dividends
- Capital appreciation opportunity
- Higher risk, higher potential reward

**Preferred Stock**:
- Fixed dividend payments
- Priority over common stock in bankruptcy
- Limited voting rights
- Less price volatility

### Growth Stocks vs. Value Stocks

**Growth Stocks**: Companies expected to grow faster than the market average
- High P/E ratios
- Reinvest profits rather than pay dividends
- Examples: Technology companies, emerging sectors

**Value Stocks**: Undervalued companies trading below their intrinsic value
- Lower P/E ratios
- Often pay dividends
- Examples: Established companies in mature industries

## Key Stock Market Metrics

### Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)

Formula: Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share

A P/E ratio of 15 means investors are willing to pay $15 for every $1 of earnings.
- High P/E: Growth expectations or overvaluation
- Low P/E: Value opportunity or struggling company

### Market Capitalization

Total value of all company shares: Share Price × Total Shares Outstanding

**Categories**:
- **Large-cap**: $10 billion+ (stable, established)
- **Mid-cap**: $2-10 billion (growth potential, moderate risk)
- **Small-cap**: $300 million-$2 billion (high growth, higher risk)

### Dividend Yield

Annual dividend per share ÷ Stock price

A 3% dividend yield means you earn $3 annually for every $100 invested.

### Beta

Measures volatility compared to the overall market:
- Beta = 1: Moves with the market
- Beta > 1: More volatile than market
- Beta < 1: Less volatile than market

## Understanding Market Indices

### Major U.S. Indices

**S&P 500**: 500 largest U.S. companies, weighted by market cap
- Represents about 80% of total U.S. market value
- Considered the best gauge of large-cap U.S. stocks

**Dow Jones Industrial Average**: 30 large, blue-chip companies
- Price-weighted index
- Oldest U.S. market index

**NASDAQ Composite**: All NASDAQ-listed stocks
- Heavy technology focus
- Over 3,000 companies

### Why Indices Matter

- Foundation for index funds and ETFs

## Investment Strategies for Beginners

### Buy and Hold

Long-term strategy focusing on quality companies:

### Dollar-Cost Averaging

Invest fixed amounts at regular intervals:

### Diversification

Spread investments across:
- Different sectors (tech, healthcare, finance)
- Asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate)
- Geographic regions (domestic, international)

**Rule of Thumb**: Don't put more than 5-10% in any single stock.

## Risk Management

### Understand Your Risk Tolerance

Consider:
- Investment timeline (years until you need the money)

- Age and life stage

### Common Risks

**Market Risk**: Overall market declines affecting all stocks
**Company Risk**: Specific issues with individual companies
**Liquidity Risk**: Difficulty selling when you want to
**Inflation Risk**: Purchasing power erosion over time

### Stop-Loss Orders

Automatic sell order triggered when stock hits certain price:
- Limits potential losses

**The Mistake**: Putting all money in one or two stocks
**The Fix**: Spread across at least 10-15 positions

### 4. Ignoring Fees

**The Mistake**: Not considering trading costs and expense ratios

### 6. Not Having an Exit Strategy

**The Mistake**: No plan for when to sell
**The Fix**: Set profit targets and stop-losses before buying

## Building Long-Term Wealth
