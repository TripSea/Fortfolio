The iron condor is one of the most popular options strategies for generating income in range-bound markets. When executed properly, it offers defined risk, high probability setups, and consistent returns. Let's break down everything you need to know.

## What Is an Iron Condor?

An iron condor combines four options contracts:
- **Sell** an out-of-the-money (OTM) put
- **Buy** a further OTM put (lower strike)
- **Sell** an OTM call
- **Buy** a further OTM call (higher strike)

All contracts share the same expiration date, creating a position that profits when the underlying stays within a defined range.

## The Mechanics

### Position Structure

Let's use a practical example with SPY trading at $450:

**Put Spread (Short Side):**
- Sell $440 put
- Buy $435 put

**Call Spread (Short Side):**
- Sell $460 call
- Buy $465 call

**Credit Received:** $200 (for the set)

**Maximum Risk:** $500 - $200 = $300

**Break-Even Points:** $438 and $462

## When to Use Iron Condors

Iron condors work best in these market conditions:

1. **Low to Moderate Volatility**
   - IV rank below 50%
   - Stable price action expected

2. **Range-Bound Markets**
   - Clear support and resistance
   - Consolidation patterns

3. **Post-Earnings Calm**
   - After volatility crush
   - Sideways drift expected

## Strike Selection Strategy

### The 1 Standard Deviation Approach

Sell strikes at approximately 1 standard deviation from current price. This gives roughly 68% probability of success.

### Wing Width Considerations

- **Narrow wings (5 points):** Higher credit, higher risk
- **Wide wings (10 points):** Lower credit, lower risk  
- **Sweet spot (5-7 points):** Balanced risk/reward

## Risk Management Rules

### Position Sizing
Never risk more than 2-5% of your account on a single iron condor.

### Exit Strategies

**Profit Target:** Close at 50% of max profit
- Example: $200 credit → close at $100 debit

**Stop Loss:** Close if position loses 2x initial credit
- Example: $200 credit → stop at $400 loss

**Time-Based:** Close at 21 days to expiration (DTE) if opened at 45 DTE

### Adjustment Techniques

When one side is challenged:

1. **Roll the untested side** closer to collect more credit
2. **Convert to iron butterfly** by rolling tested side to ATM
3. **Close the trade** if technical levels break

## Real-World Example

**Setup (December 1):**
- SPY at $450
- 45 days to expiration
- IV rank: 35%

**Trade:**
- Sell $440 put / Buy $435 put
- Sell $460 call / Buy $465 call
- Credit: $1.85 per share ($185 per contract)

**Management:**
- Target profit: $92.50 (50% of max)
- Stop loss: $370 (2x credit)

**Outcome (December 22):**
- SPY closes at $453
- Bought back for $0.80 debit
- Profit: $105 per contract

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Trading High Volatility
Selling iron condors into volatile markets exposes you to rapid moves beyond your strikes.

### 2. Holding to Expiration
Gamma risk explodes near expiration. Close profitable trades early.

### 3. Ignoring Technical Levels
Always check support/resistance before placing strikes.

### 4. Over-Leveraging
Multiple iron condors can seem "safe" but losses compound quickly.

## Advanced Tips

### Earnings Strategy
Place iron condors AFTER earnings when IV collapses but before the stock finds direction.

### Index vs. Single Stock
SPX/SPY iron condors offer:
- Better liquidity
- More predictable movement
- European-style settlement (SPX)

Single stocks offer:
- Higher premiums
- More setups available
- Greater risk of big moves

## Conclusion

The iron condor is an excellent strategy for consistent income when markets lack clear direction. Success requires:

- Proper market selection
- Strategic strike placement  
- Disciplined risk management
- Patient trade execution

Start small, track your results, and refine your approach over time.
